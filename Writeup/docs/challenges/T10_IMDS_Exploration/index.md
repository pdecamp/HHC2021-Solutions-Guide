# IMDS Exploration Terminal Challenge

## Troll Introduction

??? quote "Help Noxious O'Dor in Jack's Executive Restroom"
    Hey, this is the executive restroom. Wasn't that door closed?<br>
    I’m Noxious O’Dor. And I’ve gotta say, I think that Jack Frost is just messed up.<br>
    I mean, I'm no expert, but his effort to "win" against Santa by going bigger and bolder seems bad.<br>
    You know, I’m having some trouble with this IMDS exploration. I’m hoping you can give me some help in solving it.<br>
    If you do, I’ll be happy to trade you for some hints on SSRF! I’ve been studying up on that and have some good ideas on how to attack it!


## Open the Terminal

Open the IMDS Exploration terminal in Jack's Restroom

## Solution

This challenge is simply a tutorial on IMDS and there are no problems to solve.  Simply open the terminal and go through the steps to learn about IDMS (which will be useful for <a href="../../objectives/O10_Now_Hiring">Objective 10</a>).

    Phew! That is something extra! Oh, and you solved the challenge too? Great!<br>
    Cloud assets are interesting targets for attackers. Did you know they automatically get IMDS access?<br>
    I'm very concerned about the combination of SSRF and IMDS access.<br>
    Did you know it's possible to harvest cloud keys through SSRF and IMDS attacks?<br>
    Dr. Petabyte told us, "anytime you see URL as an input, test for SSRF."<br>
    With an SSRF attack, we can make the server request a URL. This can reveal valuable data!<br>
    The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html">AWS documentation for IMDS</a> is interesting reading.
