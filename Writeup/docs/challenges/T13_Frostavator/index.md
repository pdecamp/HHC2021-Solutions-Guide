# Frostavator Terminal Challenge

## Troll Introduction

??? quote "Help Grody Goiterson in the Frost Tower Lobby"
    Hrmph. Snrack! Pthbthbthb.<br>
    Gnerphk. Well, on to business.<br>
    I'm Grody Goiterson. ... It's a family name.<br>
    So hey, this is the Frostavator. It runs on some logic chips... that fell out.<br>
    I put them back in, but I must have mixed them up, because it isn't working now.<br>
    If you don't know much about logic gates, it's something you should look up.<br>
    If you help me run the elevator, maybe I can help you with something else.<br>
    I'm pretty good with FPGAs, if that's worth something to ya'.

## Hints and Other Resources

## Completion

??? quote "Talk to Grody after getting the Frostavator running to receive hints for <a href="../../objectives/O13_FPGA_Programming/">Objective 13) FPGA Programming</a>"   
    Oooo... That's it!<br>
    A deal's a deal. Let's talk FPGA.<br>
    First, did you know there are people who do this stuff <a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox.html">for fun</a>?<br>
    I mean, I'm more into picking on other trolls for fun, but whatever.<br>
    Also, that Prof. Petabyte guy is giving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFdG1PJ4QjA">a talk</a> about FPGAs. Weirdo.<br>
    So hey, good luck or whatever.
