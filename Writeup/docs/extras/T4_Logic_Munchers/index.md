## All the Hints

At each difficulty level the game will provide you with some techniques for solving the logic equations.  This table lists all the hints in one easy to read location.

| Difficulty | Hint |
| ---------- | ---- |
| Beginner - Boolean | Eat only "True" and "not False" challenges - or like "0=0". |
| Intermediate - Boolean | If A and B are both true, then "A and B" is true. If either is true, then "A or B" is true. |
| Advanced - Boolean | Don't get thrown off; "not True" is the same as "False," and vice versa. |
| Expert - Boolean | Try reducing the contents of parenthesis to "True" or "False," then solve the simplified statement. |
| Beginner - Arithmetic | The "!=" operator means "is not equal to." |
| Intermediate - Arithmetic | Don't get thrown off by negative results |
| Advanced - Arithmetic | The "%" or "modulo" operator asks the remainder when numbers are divided. |
| Expert - Arithmetic | If you see the "**" operator, it means "to the power of." |
| Beginner / Intermediate - Number Conversions | 0b0001 in binary is 1 in decimal, 0b0010 is 2, 0b0011 is 3, 0b0100 is 4... |
| Advanced / Expert - Number Conversions | 0x09 in hexadecimal is 9 in decimal, 0x0A is 10, 0x0F is 15, 0x10 is 16... |
| Beginner - Bitwise | The "bit shift" operators slide bits left or right with a fresh "0." |
| Intermediate - Bitwise | A bitwise AND(&) is like a logical "And" where 1 = true and 0 = false. OR(||) works like a logical "Or." |
| Advanced / Expert - Bitwise | A bitwise XOR(^ or âŠ•) returns 1 only when exactly one of the input bits is 1. |
